# DataFaux

DataFaux is a plugin that creates meaningless web data by navigating your browser randomly around a list of sites, to confound tracking & personalization algorithms and burst filter bubbles.

This project is based on the project Noiszy, which is no longer actively maintained. Learn more about that project at [noiszy.com](https://noiszy.com/) and the [Noiszy blog](https://noiszy.com/blog/).

I wanted to keep the project going and hopefully make a few changes to the project. Here we go!

I'm planning on removing the Google Analytics snippits put here by the origional creator.
